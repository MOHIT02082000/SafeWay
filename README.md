# Inspiration
Due to an increase in the number of homeless people, street crime is on the rise. We hear about street crime on a daily basis. Women confront difficulties while going out late at night. To combat this, we want to develop a web application that allows users to save and browse safe and risky areas based on their own personal experiences. The app will have a map-like user interface that will highlight the severity of crimes as you go across the area. To help the homeless even more, we have a contribution option that allows any user to contribute any clothes or food to them as long as they know their location through the application.

# What it Does
The app will have a map-like user interface that will highlight the severity of crimes as you go across the area. To help the homeless even more, we have a donation option that allows any user to contribute any clothes or food to them as long as they know their location through the web application.
